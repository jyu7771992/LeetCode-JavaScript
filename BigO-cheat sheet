## - Big Os
O(1) - Constant - no loop
O(log N) - Logarithmic - usually searching algorithms have log(n) if they are sorted (Binary Search) ( not on hash map)
O(n) - Linear - for loops while loops
O(n * log(n)) Log Linear - Sorting operations usually
O(n^2) Quadratic - every element in a collection needs to be compared to every other element. Two nested loops.
O(2^n) Exponential - recursive algorithms that solve a problem of size n
O(n!) Factorial - you are adding a loop for every element
